When you create a training set you have to note, that 
all values have to be in interval (0..1).


How to use Neural Network:

1) You have to make a training set.
		Example: 
		
		1 		0		0
		1		0.1		1
		0.7 	0.1 	1
		0.3 	0.1 	0.5
		
	First number is a normalized Health of bot
	Second number is a normalized Number of Zombies near bot (suppose 10 zombies is max value. 0.1 - means one zombi, 0.2 - two zombies)
	The last number is a result  (in script we check: if(res<0.3) then do nothing; if(res>0.3 && res<0.6) run away; if(res>0.6) shoot)

2) Open the AI window:  Window --> AI

3) Fill in first to string fields
			Example:
			Assets\AI\DataAI\StudyFile.txt
			Assets\AI\DataAI\Save.txt
			
4) Number of layers usually from 4 to 7
   In this example we have two input parameters and one output. 			
   That's why first layer have two neurons, last layer have one neuron.
   You can experiment choosing various numbers of neurons in hidden layers (all layers exept first and last)
   			Example:
   			
   			Layers = 4
   			Number of neurons in layer one = 2
   			Number of neurons in layer two = 10
   			Number of neurons in layer three = 10
   			Number of neurons in layer four = 1
   			
5) Click button "Create and Study AI" and wait from several seconds to several minutes.  

6) Now the network done. To control the bot use class "Control" 			
			Example C#:
			//----------------------------------------------
			Control myControl = new Control(SaveFileFolder);  
			myControl.LoadFromFile();
			//----------------------------------------------
			
			//Network loaded. 
			Usage Example:
			//----------------------------------------------
			float[] output = myControl.Manipulate(Input)
			//----------------------------------------------
			
			//the output is the array of outputs
			//in my example script (SmartBot.cs) i use only one output.
